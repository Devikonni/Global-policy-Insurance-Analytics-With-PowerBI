# Global-policy-Insurance-Analytics-With-PowerBI
Overview
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard developed during my internship at Ai Variant. The dashboard provides comprehensive insights into global insurance policies, customer demographics, payments, and claims across various regions, including North America, Europe, Australia, and parts of Africa.

Datasets Used
Global Insurance Policies Dataset: Information on policy types, issuance dates, and statuses.​

Customer Demographics Dataset: Details about policyholders, such as age, gender, and location.​

Claims Dataset: Records of insurance claims, including claim amounts and approval statuses.​
GitHub
 

Payments & Revenue Dataset: Data on premium payments and revenue figures.​
 
Workflow & Tech Stack
Data Collection & Cleaning: Utilized Power Query to import and preprocess data, ensuring accuracy and consistency.​

Data Modeling & Visualization: Employed Power BI to create relationships between datasets and develop interactive visualizations using DAX for measures and calculated columns.​

Key Insights & Recommendations
Policies Overview
Observation: Retention rates fluctuate, with a higher number of expired policies compared to active ones. Health and Life insurance policies dominate the coverage distribution.​

Recommendation: Implement targeted renewal strategies and offer flexible options to enhance policy retention. Focus marketing efforts during low-issuance months to stabilize policy issuance rates.​

Customer Demographics
Observation: Middle-aged and senior customers contribute significantly to premium revenues. Customer concentration is notable in specific regions.​

Recommendation: Personalize insurance offerings for key demographics and age groups. Expand marketing initiatives beyond concentrated regions to attract a broader customer base.​

Claims Analysis
Observation: Claim approval rates are low, with health and property claims leading in volume. A few customers are associated with high claim amounts, indicating potential fraud risks.​

Recommendation: Streamline claim approval processes to improve customer trust and satisfaction. Enhance fraud detection mechanisms to mitigate risks associated with high-value claims.​

Payments & Revenue
Observation: Revenue exhibits fluctuations, with 2024 showing a decline compared to previous years. Payment failures are notably high, particularly among high-value customers.​

Recommendation: Improve payment methods by introducing alternative options to reduce failures. Strengthen communication with high-value customers to address payment issues promptly.​

How to Use
Access the Dashboard: Open the provided .pbix file using Power BI Desktop.​
 

Interact with Visuals: Utilize slicers and filters to explore data across different regions, policy types, and customer segments.​

Analyze Insights: Review the visualizations to gain a deeper understanding of the insurance business performance and identify areas for improvement.​
 

Conclusion
This Power BI dashboard offers valuable insights into global insurance operations, aiding stakeholders in making informed, data-driven decisions. By analyzing policies, customer demographics, claims, and revenue, the dashboard serves as a strategic tool for enhancing business performance in the insurance sector.
